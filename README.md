  ## The 1d Isling Model 

We use the vector data structure to model the spins of the atoms. The vector data structure is ideal because of:
  - Dynamic Size: The number of spins (num_spins) is set dynamically during runtime, making vectors ideal for storage.
  - Efficiency: Provides fast access and modifications crucial for simulation performance.
  - Convenience: Built-in functionalities like indexing, iteration, and standard algorithms simplifyÂ operations.
